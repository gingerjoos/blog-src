`Michael Jackson is no
more <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8119993.stm>`__.

    Paramedics were called to the singer's home around midday local time
    on Thursday after he stopped breathing.

    He was pronounced dead two hours later at the UCLA medical centre. A
    spokesman for the centre said the star died of a suspected heart
    attack.

There's hardly a human begin in the world who would not have heard of
this man. I didn't really grow up listening to a lot of what we call
"western music", but even for me as a child he was a legend. Who does
not know of the moonwalk and all those moves that he made so famous. He
was a musical genius no doubt, but he was famous for more than that. He
will be remembered for generations to come not just as a musician but
the controversies surrounding him, the causes he championed and for the
sheer story of his life.

At this moment, I believe it's important that we recognise the great
things MJ did as a musician and human being. We recognise him for the
causes he championed. We listen to the message in his life. When this
man goes down in history, let us remember the value he gave us.

Rest In Peace, MJ.
