|Masala Dosa in Bengaluru|

It must be something in the genes. Mallus and Tams are like peas in a
pod. Especially when it comes to food.

So for a poor mallu lad fed up with the over - oiled Masala dosas of
Bangalore where is the refuge? Obviously a Tamil hotel. And so it was
that I found `Pongal at Jeevan Bhima Nagar <http://is.gd/tuTR>`__. 22 Rs
for a decent masala dosa. Not bad :)
