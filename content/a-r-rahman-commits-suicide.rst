Yep. That's my prediction for tomorrow's headline. All that Rahman has
to do is see BJP's ad. It sux big time!

Is it too much to ask for a decent ad? Not asking for a miracle, am I?
Damn, that track made me want to throw up.

Mind, I'm not an anti - BJP guy really. I don't really like the
political ads the parties are coming up with either. But I hate to see
good music destroyed.

 :D
