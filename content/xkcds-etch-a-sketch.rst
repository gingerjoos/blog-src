`Debian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian>`__'s version 4.0 was
called Etch. It was named after the etch-a-sketch in Toy Story,
following Debian traditions of naming it's versions after Toy Story
characters (the current version, 5.0, is called Lenny).

This post isn't on Debian. It's about `xkcd
#551 <http://xkcd.com/551/>`__. It's also based on etch-a-sketch. It's
one of my favourites, I guess. I suppose I can understand how the guy
must be feeling. Take a look -
