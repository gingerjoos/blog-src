Forgot to print the ticket you got from IRCTC? Not a problem, if you
have a copy of the ticket in your laptop or mobile. As per the latest
IRCTC notification (emphasis added) -

    Electronic Reservation Slip (ERS) - The printout in standard
    specified Performa containing reservation particulars, and
    instructions for use which can be used by the passenger along with
    the relevant authorized Identification, as travel authority for
    performing the journey.

    **Virtual Reservation Message (VRM) - A screen-shot of the e-ticket
    displayed through laptops/palmtops/ Mobile phone** is referred as
    Virtual Reservation Message (VRM).

    ERS/VRM along with any one of the eight prescribed ID proofs in
    original and the indication of the passenger(s)' name(s) in the
    Reservation Chart will authorize the passenger to travel.

    **VRM combined with valid photo-id in original will be treated as an
    instrument on par with the ERS**.

    ERS/VRM along with one of the eight prescribed proofs of identity in
    original will also authorize the passenger to enter the platform on
    the day of journey and he/she will not be required to purchase
    platform ticket. ERS/VRM along with original id proof will be
    required to be produced on demand of Ticket Checking Staff on the
    platform.

-- as per https://www.irctc.co.in/VRM.htm

What this means is that you can show a screenshot or pdf of the ticket
from IRCTC along with your ID card in original (which you needed to
anyway) instead of a printout.

Save paper, save trees. What an idea, sirjee :)
