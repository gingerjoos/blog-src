Came across an interesting article on Wired.

    NEW YORK -- Amid the documentaries and live-action features at this
    year's Tribeca Film Festival is a first for the event -- a
    feature-length, computer-generated animated film rendered entirely
    by a single animator, working out of a home office.

    Nina Paley's Sita Sings the Blues, which makes its North American
    premiere Friday at the festival, tells two parallel stories: the
    ancient Hindu epic the Ramayana and the breakup of Paley's
    21st-century marriage. It does so through four distinct styles of
    animation, a "greek chorus" of Indonesian shadow puppets and wildly
    imaginative musical interludes that use authentic 1920s blues
    recordings to link narratives 3,000 years apart.

The article has got an interview of Nina Paley as well as a trailer of
the film.

From what I read from the article, it features Rama leaving Sita.

    **Wired:** You voiced the role of yourself, and that leads to the
    film's most excruciating scene, in which your character asks your
    husband to take you back.

    **Paley:** [Laughs.] Isn't that pathetic? I wanted people to *feel
    my pain*. And believe me, that's just a little taste of it.
    [Laughs.] When this sort of thing happens to you, it's so shameful,
    so humiliating. Which is why I included that scene of Sita sitting
    there on the banks of the river saying, "I must have committed a
    terrible sin in a previous life to deserve such suffering." There's
    always a sense that, if something bad happens to you, that there's
    something really wrong with you. And I love that even Sita believes
    this, because she's completely stainless, that's the whole point of
    her character. I feel that airing this stuff out is the way to take
    the shame out of it. Plus, pain is funny!

The Ramayana says that Rama chose to leave Sita because of his duty as a
king. In the otherwise spotless character of Rama, I feel, this is a
huge blemish. And so do a lot of people. Many "experts" though have felt
otherwise.

Should be interesting to see how Ramayana and the character of Sita is
treated in this film.
