A while ago I got a message on my mobile from "TM-Orkut". It was a scrap
written by a friend on my `Orkut <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut>`__
scrapbook. I suppose this means they're trying out mobile updates.
There's nothing about this yet on the Orkut blog. Looking forward to
this feature. Hope it comes soon.

In case you have any news, do leave them as comments :)
