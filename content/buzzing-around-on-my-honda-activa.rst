At Bangalore I'm usually driving my bicycle - either to office or short
trips to, say, nearby stores. Occassionally I get to drive my friend's
Activa.

At Ernakulam, where I'm from, I drive a Honda Activa (current active
user : my sister). Was home for about a week recently and I rediscovered
the joys of driving it. The Activa is Honda's big hit in India. Easy to
use (automatic gears) but powerful enough, it's a pretty good vehicle.
Especially in cities. It was wonderful to once again feel the wind in my
face (figuratively, I was wearing a helmet of course) and the rush of
speed (only 40 kmph, but still good enough for me :D).

I would love to own an electric vehicle like the Activa sometime. Wonder
when one will reach these shores.
