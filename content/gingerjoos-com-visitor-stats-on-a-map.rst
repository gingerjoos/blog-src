My friend Arun Prabhakar recently started playing around with some
`visitor stats reporting <http://stats.kitiyo.com/>`__ for his site. He
has been gracious enough to extend the service to his friends and now
the public as well(by invitation only) :) The service is still in beta,
so occassional hiccups might occur. He's been adding more and more tools
to complement the visitor count. You can check out the stats on the
right sidebar of this blog. So if you want to put in a nice `stat
counter <http://stats.kitiyo.com/>`__ for your blog or website, head
over to http://stats.kitiyo.com/.

He's just completed a see-your-visitors-on-a-map feature. Here's what it
looks like for this blog.

He has very kindly provided a limited-time special invitation code for
Gingerjoos.com visitors :) Use the invitation code **iwantitbadly** to
sign up for the service at `Kitiyo stats <http://stats.kitiyo.com/>`__.
