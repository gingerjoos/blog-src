We are used to the idea of the Internet being free - free as in Freedom,
though not always in price. It is difficult to accept government control
over something we have so carefully guarded. But `it is
coming <http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3423018.ece>`__
whether we like it or not. You may be in a democracy (the United States,
India) or you may be in a dictatorship (China). Governments everywhere
are trying to take control. Along with the government, powerful
organisations (MPAA and RIAA, for eg.) will also get control. `We do our
best <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA>`__ to
prevent our loss of control, but over time those with power will win. We
have to accept this fact.

Having accepted the fact what can we do about it? Rewrite. It is time we
moved towards the new Internet. The new Internet will have many
challenges to solve. Censorship is only one of the many challenges.
Connectivity is another. While average Internet speeds have increased
over the years, we still haven't seen the huge jumps promised by the
next big improvement (TM). Connections are unreliable - be it in the
`skyscrapers of New
York <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antennagate#Antenna>`__ or the
villages of Africa. The are many `technical
challenges <http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3937604>`__ to solve.

While those with power have many weapons at hand - court orders to new
laws - we have one weapon they don't have. We are smart. We know
science. Before it's too late, before they take away the Internet from
us, we must fight back. The new Internet needs to grapple with all these
issues. It must be deliberately decentralised so that any attempt at
censorship would be technically infeasible. We are
`taking <http://mosh.mit.edu/>`__ `baby <http://webp2p.org/>`__
`steps <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY>`__, but we have light years
to go before we sleep.
