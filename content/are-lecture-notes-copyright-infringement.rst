University of Florida professor Michael Moulton thinks copyright law
protects the lectures he gives to his students, and he's headed to court
to prove it.

Moulton and his e-textbook publisher are suing Thomas Bean, who runs a
company that repackages and sells student notes, arguing that the
business is illegal since notes taken during college lectures violate
the professor's copyright.

This would be funny if this wasn't an actual court case.

Doesn't `common sense
revolt <http://www.lessig.org/blog/2005/09/google_sued.html>`__ at this
very idea? What is worse is that a Professor, someone who is supposed to
spread ideas and mould the young, has taken this step.

Perhaps the day is not far when copyright notices will be put up in
lecture halls and agreements signed before the beginning of each lecture
in the temples of our learning. Perhaps the day is not far when true
culture will cease to exist.
