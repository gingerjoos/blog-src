Happened to read this at Slashdot :

    An anonymous reader notes that Comcast is offering a new `50-Mbps /
    6-Mbps
    package <http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i36yFNSNsK4z--hcXuM1iZp1tRMQD8VQ17Q80>`__
    for residential customers for $150, starting in Minneapolis-St. Paul
    and extending nationwide by mid-2010. The new service will use the
    DOCSIS 3.0 standard, which is nearing ratification. We've recently
    discussed Comcast's `BitTorrent
    throttling <http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/09/04/2014236.shtml?tid=172>`__
    and `promise to quit
    it <http://tech.slashdot.org/tech/08/03/27/149253.shtml?tid=95>`__,
    and their `low-quality 'HD'
    programming <http://slashdot.org/mainpage/08/03/30/2113218.shtml?tid=129>`__.
    How attractive will $150 for 50 Mbps be compared to Verizon's FiOS
    offerings?

This is crazy!!! And totally unfair! :( Here in India the fastest
"broadband" that we can get is a 2Mbps ADSL connection that comes to
around `500
rupees <http://www.google.co.in/search?q=500+indian+rupees+in+dollars&sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1B3GGGL_enIN266IN266>`__
(excluding tax). And just compare prices. Makes my heart break :( I've
heard that broadband services are better and cheaper (than in the US) in
some other countries (Korea? Japan?).

I wish affordable Broadband comes to India. It isn't like there is no
market here for proper broadband. The demand is there, the supply is
absent.
