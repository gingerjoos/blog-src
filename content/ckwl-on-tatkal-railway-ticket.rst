So the other day I booked a tatkal ticket online from
`IRCTC <http://irctc.co.in/>`__. After the usual
`500 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Status#5xx_Server_Error>`__
errors and multiple tries I came to the "Congratulations!" page where
they gave me the ticket details. And this is what I found in the
ticket's status "CKWL 23". I wondered what the heck it was. Googling did
not help. I shot off a mail to the IRCTC customer care and within half
an hour I got their reply. Reproducing their reply below -

    Dear Customer,

    Kindly note that CK stands for Tatkal CKWL means Tatkal Wait list
    Ticket.

    Thanks & Regards

So there it goes. Official reply from IRCTC. CKWL is the waiting list
for the tatkal quota. It's just like the "WL" you get on the normal
ticket, except it's on the tatkal quota. No idea what CK stands for
though.

Although the reply wasn't exactly Shakespeare, I was impressed that they
got back to me so soon. It's nice to see the Railways doing good stuff.
There's still room to improve though.

Have you had a similar experience with IRCTC? Frustrating one? Good one?
The comment form is right below :)

**Update :** Found something in the IRCTC site in the ngpay
`FAQ <http://www.irctc.co.in/ngpay/faq.htm>`__. It says(in point 9)

    Booking can be done against general (GN), ladies (LD) and tatkal
    (CK) quota berths/seats only.

    Â 

. What this means is that GNWL is General Quota Waiting list, LDWL is
Ladies Quota Waiting List and CKWL is Tatkal Quota Waiting list. Pretty
much any 4 letter acronym ending in WL is some Waiting list quota or
another. For instance if you have been wondering what `PQWL
means </blog/misc/pqwl-status-on-railway-ticket>`__ in IRCTC, then it is
a Pooled Quota Waiting List.
