Indian Railways is going to bring out a new e-ticketing service like the
IRCTC, says `Economic
Times <http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/indian-railways-to-roll-out-new-e-ticketing-service/articleshow/9109489.cms>`__.
The new service is meant only for users and not for agents. IRCTC allows
both agents and passengers to book tickets from its site. `"irctc
login" <http://gingerjoos.com/blog/misc/booking-tatkal-tickets-on-irctc-the-supercool-way>`__
was the most searched term on Google India in the year 2010. The site is
often overloaded and unusable. This is particularly so at 8 a.m. on
Fridays and Wednesdays. The huge traffic on the site results in a very
slow experience while booking. The payment and booking often fails.

One hopes that the new website would go on to be much better than the
IRCTC. Of primary importance would be scalability - it should handle
heavy load from it's users and still provide a reasonably fast
experience. Improved user experience would also be welcome. Another site
that they own - http://indianrail.gov.in/ - is a brilliant example of
how a website should NOT be designed.

Here's to the Indian Railways wishing them the best in their endeavour.
Be tuned for more updates :)
