Saw an `article on
Wired <http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/Y/YAHOO_ICAHN?SITE=WIRE&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2008-05-15-05-28-34>`__
about `Carl Icahn <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn>`__ and
Yahoo! Basically Icahn wants to replace the current board of directors
at Yahoo! with his own and pursue the Microsoft deal all over again. The
New York Times has published the `letter sent by Icahn to the chairman
of
Yahoo <http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/business/16icahnletter.html?_r=1&oref=slogin>`__.

I doubt any good will come out of this. Personally, I think Yahoo! and
Microsoft are incompatible companies and a merger between the two will
only lead to disaster.

I don't know what the problem is with this guy. Wikipedia says -

Icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless `corporate
raider <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_raid>`__ after his
`hostile takeover <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover>`__ of
`TWA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines>`__ in
`1985 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985>`__.\ :sup:`[1] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Icahn#cite_note-0>`__`
The result of that takeover was Icahn systematically stripping TWA of
its assets and selling them off.

I hope Icahn doesn't end up ruining Yahoo!. Somebody put some sense into
him.
