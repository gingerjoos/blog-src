Happy New Year to all... :-)

I decided to celebrate the transition from the old to the new with a
difference this time. I slept through it ;-) For the past few years I've
been staying up till the clock rang 12. This time though I was sound
asleep. Aah..what bliss!

I recommend that you try it yourself next time. :-)
