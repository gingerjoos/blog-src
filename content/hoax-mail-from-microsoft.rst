This is a mail I got

    Dear Microsoft Customer,

    Please notice that Microsoft company has recently issued a Security
    Update for OS Microsoft Windows. The update applies to the following
    OS versions: Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft
    Windows Millenium, Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows Vista.

    Please notice, that present update applies to high-priority updates
    category. In order to help protect your computer against security
    threats and performance problems, we strongly recommend you to
    install this update.

    Since public distribution of this Update through the official
    website `http://www.microsoft.com <http://www.microsoft.com/>`__
    would have result in efficient creation of a malicious software, we
    made a decision to issue an experimental private version of an
    update for all Microsoft Windows OS users.

    As your computer is set to receive notifications when new updates
    are available, you have received this notice.

    | In order to start the update, please follow the step-by-step
      instruction:
    |  1. Run the file, that you have received along with this message.
    |  2. Carefully follow all the instructions you see on the screen.

    If nothing changes after you have run the file, probably in the
    settings of your OS you have an indication to run all the updates at
    a background routine. In that case, at this point the upgrade of
    your OS will be finished.

    We apologize for any inconvenience this back order may be causing
    you.

    Thank you,

    | Steve Lipner
    |  Director of Security Assurance
    |  Microsoft Corp.

This is a better crafted hoax than others out there :) Still quite a few
flaws ;) So don't go and "install" the "update".

#. Microsoft "company"
#. OS Microsoft Windows

A typical update from Microsoft would be something like this :
