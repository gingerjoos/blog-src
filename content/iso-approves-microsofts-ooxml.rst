The `International Organization for
Standardization(ISO) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO>`__ has approved
Microsoft's `OOXML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOXML>`__ as a
standard.

    ISO/IEC DIS 29500, I\ *nformation technology â€“ Office Open XML file
    formats*, has received the necessary number of votes for approval as
    an ISO/IEC International Standard.

    Approval required at least 2/3 (i.e. 66.66 %) of the votes cast by
    national bodies participating in the joint technical committee
    ISO/IEC JTC 1, *Information technology*, to be positive; and no more
    than 1/4 (i.e. 25 %) of the total number of ISO/IEC national body
    votes cast to be negative. These criteria have now been met with 75
    % of the JTC 1 participating member votes cast positive and 14 % of
    the total of national member body votes cast negative.

Lots of us in India were happy that
`BIS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Standards>`__ had
decided to vote against OOXML. Short - lived happiness as it turns out.
