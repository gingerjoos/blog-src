I am back... :-)

I couldn't use the computer for a few days due to hardware failure. I
called up the technician and he came in and took a look at the system.
Turned out the RAM was loosely fixed on to the slot. Damn! And they
charged me
`Rs.200 <http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&q=200+indian+rupees+in+us+dollars&btnG=Search&meta=>`__
. :-(

I keep shifting my computer this side and that because I keep switching
between my headphones and speakers. There isn't place in the front to
plug in the headphones. So I've to move the system, remove the speaker
pin at the back and insert the headphone pin. ThisÂ  rough shaking
apparently has loosened the RAM from the slot and hence the problem.

Worst part is : I lost 200 bucks :-( My father is not going to be happy
about this.
