The tabloid, National Enquirer, has claimed that Steve Jobs has only 6
weeks to live. Their website does not reveal much. It says "Shocking
photos obtained exclusively by The ENQUIRER show the 56-year-old
cancer-stricken computer genius has become rail-thin and heartbreakingly
weak in recent days despite putting up a tremendously courageous
battle." and "But after studying the new photos of the world-renowned
entrepreneur - taken on February 8th in California - medical experts
consulted by The ENQUIRER say it appears he's losing his battle." I do
not know how much to believe a doctor who has predicted the time to live
for a person by looking at the photograph, but the Enquirer seems to
have much faith - 'One of our experts - Boca Raton, Fla., critical care
physician Dr. Samuel Jacobson, who has not treated Jobs - told The
ENQUIRER: "The poor guy! Judging from these photos, he is close to
terminal. I would say he has six weeks.' . If it is indeed true, then
this is very sad news indeed.
