We've heard the same thing an umpteen number of times - drive carefully.
It is refreshing to hear the same thing being gently given to you
instead of pushing it with a stick down your throat. Lest you think
that's all there is to Engeyum Eppothum, the movie boasts of excellent
characterisation and brilliant performances from its leading cast. M
Saravanan has shown that good cinema does not require a superstar and
that good cinema will be accepted by audiences.

The movie opens with a horrifying accident involving 2 buses - one
heading from Trichy to Chennai and the other in the opposite route. The
film then unravels some of the characters in the buses and takes the
audience to the lives and love. Each of those characters offer a chance
to connect. You would stand by idly and move on in accident involving
people you do not know. You would be actively involved in the rescue
effort if a loved one's life is at stake. This film gives you ordinary
characters you can connect with and through their pain, feel disturbed.
This is,perhaps, in contrast to the young men in
`Ko <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_%28film%29>`__ whose desire to see
a change in the political system is not explained with much depth. Other
devices were employed by the filmmakers to keep the audience connect.

Among the characters in the movie the character of Manimegalai ( played
by `Anjali <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjali_%28actress%29>`__ )
stands out. Anjali portrays the strong Nurse brilliantly. Practical to
the point of being blunt, her antics finds us giving her a special place
in our hearts. Kathiresan, played by
`Jai <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_%28actor%29>`__, provides an
excellent foil to Manimegalai. Simple and naive, his true love makes him
endearing to the audience. The two other leads - Amutha (
`Ananya <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ananya_%28actress%29>`__ ) and
Gautham ( `Sharvanand <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharvanand>`__ )
also plays their role very well. There are some side characters, like a
Gulf returnee who is dying to finally meet his daughter, who provide
richness to the texture of the film.

In this age of superstar movies and mindless song - dance routines this
film provides a welcome relief. Do watch it.
