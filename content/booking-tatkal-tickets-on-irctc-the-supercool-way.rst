Update : IRCTC has blocked Quick book from 8 AM - 9 AM. This method will
not be useful in such a scenario.

This article is a short demo to using Firefox's `Autofill
Forms <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4775>`__ extension
to book tatkal tickets. First step is to go to
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4775 and install the
extension. You'll need to restart Firefox for the extension to take
effect.

Now that it's done, head to the `IRCTC <http://irctc.co.in/>`__
website and login. Now head to the Quick Book page. You can fill in the
details.\ |quick book on IRCTC|
If you do not know the train number, you can get it from the "Plan My
Travel" page. Now that you've filled up all the details you want to,
right click on one of the form textboxes.

Edit : IRCTC has now disabled right clicks. As a workaround you need to
paste ``javascript:void(document.oncontextmenu=null)``\ into your
address bar to re-enable the right click. See my post on `IRCTC's
disabled right
click <http://gingerjoos.com/blog/misc/irctc-disabled-right-click>`__.

Click on the "Add complete form as profile" option.\ |add complete form
as profile|

A new window like this will now open up

|Autofill forms profile|

You can close the window and reload the QuickBook page. Press the Alt+j
key combination to autofill the form. You can reload the page as many
times as you want and press Alt+j to autofill.

This post is dedicated to my good friend Dhanya.

**Edit :** OK, I'm giving into blackmail from someone crafty and
cunning(not my words) :P

    @gjoos : i want my name included in that blogpost if you want me to
    TRY booking tickets for you tomorrow !!! :P

So, Divya chechi.. this post is dedicated to you as well :P
