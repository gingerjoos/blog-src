It's been a long time since I blogged. What made me come out of
hibernation?

`Demonoid <http://www.demonoid.com/>`__, the popular `BitTorrent
tracker <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker>`__ has been
shut down. It says :

    The CRIA threatened the company renting the servers to us, and
    because of this it is not possible to keep the site online. Sorry
    for the inconvenience and thanks for your understanding.

It's come up on
`Slashdot <http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/26/132204&from=rss>`__
and
`Digg <http://digg.com/tech_news/Demonoid_Down_AGAIN_Hosts_Threatened_by_CRIA>`__.
CRIA is apparently -

    The **Canadian Recording Industry Association** is a
    `non-profit <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit>`__ `trade
    organization <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_trade_group>`__
    that was founded in `1964 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964>`__ to
    represent the interests of American companies that
    `create <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create>`__,
    `manufacture <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacture>`__ and
    `market <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market>`__ `sound
    recordings <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording>`__ in
    `Canada <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada>`__. The organization
    is based in `Toronto <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto>`__.

    CRIA is governed by a `board of
    directors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors>`__ who
    are elected annually by CRIA members. To be eligible for election a
    candidate for the board must be among the `chief executive
    officers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer>`__
    of member companies of the organization. `Graham
    Henderson <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Henderson>`__
    (Universal Music Canada) is the current president of the CRIA.

according to the `Wikipedia
article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association>`__.
There are subsections in the article on the `1st Demonoid
shutdown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association#Demonoid_shutdown>`__
and the `second Demonoid
shutdown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association#Second_Demonoid_Shutdown>`__.
`Vandal edits <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism>`__
(technically they're not Vandal edits because policy says "Even harmful
edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered
vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is
not vandalism â€” it's just not helpful, and should be removed or
restated.") are already appearing in the Wikipedia :D ( examples
`1 <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association&diff=170758425&oldid=170737314>`__
,
`2 <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Recording_Industry_Association&diff=170737014&oldid=170720590>`__
).

Down with CRIA.
