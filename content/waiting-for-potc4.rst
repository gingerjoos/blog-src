It will be great to see Capt Jack Sparrow again. Johnny Depp is one of
my favourite actors and Jack Sparrow (Capt Jack Sparrow!) is one of his
most popular roles. In a big plus, Pen√©lope Cruz is also in the movie..
yayy to that :) The stunningly beautiful and talented actress will
surely make a great addition to the movie. Geoff Rush will reprise his
role as Capt Barbossa - he was superb in the 3 movies before. Orlando
Bloom and Keira Knightly are out - that makes me happy :D In a prominent
role, `Ian McShane <http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574534/>`__ is the
famous Blackbeard in this movie. He has a great voice (Tai Lung in Kung
Fu Panda - brilliant) and acts well (The Coach in Death Race).

`Gore Verbinski <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Verbinski>`__ will
not be directing this movie. `Rob
Marshall <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Marshall>`__, director of
acclaimed movies like
`Chicago <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(2002_film)>`__ and
`Memoirs of a
Geisha <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_a_Geisha_(film)>`__,
will be directing this one. It will be interesting to see what changes
the new director brings to the series.

Also special is that this movie comes out in 3D. It is the latest fad
since Avatar - perhaps this one will stay?

So here's to the movie and here I am with fingers crossed :)
