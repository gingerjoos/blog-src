I had previously mentioned that `Indian Railways plans to introduce a
new e-ticketing
service <http://gingerjoos.com/blog/misc/indian-railways-to-bring-out-new-e-ticketing-service-like-irctc>`__
like IRCTC. Here are some of the differences noted between the two
services -

#. IRCTC is a separate corporation. Its services will likely continue.
#. IRCTC has separate logins for agents and passengers. The new service
   will be only for passengers
#. A maximum of 10 tickets can be booked per month in IRCTC. Initially
   at least, this limit will be 8 in the new service.
#. The new service will be hosted out of www.indianrailways.gov.in . The
   IRCTC website will continue to be at irctc.co.in
#. Users will have to create fresh login for the new service

More updates as I get more news. Stay tuned :)
