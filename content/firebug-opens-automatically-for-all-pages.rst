Faced this bizzare issue today in Firefox. Firebug was opening
automatically for all pages. Even on closing firebug, all I had to do
was click on a new link in the same tab for it to appear again. This
happened for all tabs.

Turns out I had accidently turned on "On for all Web Pages" option.
Right clicked on the Firebug icon to turn it off. Problem solved :D
