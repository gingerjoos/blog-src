I was browsing through the `site of a
celebrity <http://www.gulpanag.net/>`__ recently and came across the
contact page. I was shocked to find the
`captcha <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha>`__ there. Take a look
yourself and be amazed :
`http://www.gulpanag.net/contact\_gul\_panag.php <http://www.gulpanag.net/contact_gul_panag.php>`__

Why would anyone display the captcha as text ready for a bot passing by
to read? (It's even got a nice class - captchas - wrapping it) Is that
some kind of a honeypot? Is that a dummy form? Does the site admin feel
lonely because no one sends him/her mail and is hoping to at least read
spam?
