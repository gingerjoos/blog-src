The period in which you can reserve train tickets has been increased
from 90 days to 120 days. Apparently this is being done on an
experimental basis. This does not affect some short distance trains like
Taj Express and Gomti Express.

Reactions to this change have been on mostly predictable lines. Most
users have gone through a lot of wasted time and effort in booking a
ticket via IRCTC and it shows. Most of the comments were along the lines
of "`Railway tickets can now be booked 120-days in advance. That is
30-extra days for IRCTC website to die on
you <https://twitter.com/#!/JayHind/status/166846915714088960>`__\ ".
All justifiable :D
