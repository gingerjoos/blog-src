Finally, they've done it. Reactions along expected lines almost all
across the world I guess...

    \ **Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been executed by
    hanging at a secure facility in northern Baghdad for crimes against
    humanity**\ 

- `BBC Report <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6218485.stm>`__.

What this is going to do is make the situation in Iraq even worse.
Something the International community would've clearly liked to avoid.
Good luck to America now!
