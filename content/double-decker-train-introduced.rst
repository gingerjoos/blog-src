Indian Railways has introduced an AC double decker coach on the
12383(Up)/12384(Down) Howrah â€“ Dhanbad Express. It was designed
ingeniously by Research Development and Standard Organisation and
developed by Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala. The coach can run on a
train with diesel engine.

The fully air-conditioned train will have chair car coaches and will
start from Dhanbad at 5 am to arrive at Howrah at 9.15 am on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. From Howrah, it will start at
3.20 p.m. on every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and
reach Dhanbad at 7.40 p.m.

If the double-decker becomes a hit, Indian Railways will probably
release it in other trains as well. The increased carrying capacity
could be enormously useful in routes that are crying for more trains
such as Bangalore - Kerala route. I believe a lot of passengers will
travel in it for the new experience at first and then as they get used
to it will appreciate the usefulness as well.
