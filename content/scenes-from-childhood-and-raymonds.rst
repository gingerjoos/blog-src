As a child there were some iconic ads that I grew up watching. The
Cadbury's Dairy Milk ad is one. The other is the Raymond's "Complete
Man" ad.

The other day I was listening to some music and I came upon a gem.
`Kinderszenen <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderszenen>`__ ("Scenes
From Childhood"), Opus 15 composed by `Robert
Schumann <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schumann>`__.

The music is brilliant, and it's brilliant with the piano. So Melodic.
Easy to see why Raymond chose it for its ads. Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
The lovely background score on the Raymond Ads are in fact the work of
Schumann.

The Titan ads are another example of brilliant music being used in ads
(Beethoven's 5th symphony?) and so is Old Spice (Carmina Burrana). More
on that later. If you know of any more such music used in ads, let us
know in the comments section :)
