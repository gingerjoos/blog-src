I can't find a suitable translation for the malayalam word ആക്രാന്തം (
aakraantham ). The `Google
translation <http://www.google.com/dictionary?aq=f&langpair=ml|en&q=%E0%B4%86%E0%B4%95%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%B0%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%A8%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%82+&hl=en>`__
for the word is not accurate. Or is it one of those words which cannot
really be translated to another language?

I would be happy to hear about equivalent words in other languages too
:)
