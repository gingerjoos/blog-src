1. Write blog posts. Especially ones about "What not to do when you are
sleepy".

2. Write emails. Yeah, that angry one you're sending - no, don't do it.

3. Sleep on food. Unless of course you want to smell like pastries.

4. Speak on the phone. Yaawnn.. no I don't want that credit card.

5. Write code. while($i = 0) { $total += $i; }.

Â 

There are more. You have to tell me.
