Bush just won a poll, and it's not what you think

    Welcome to Wired News' 2006 Foot-in-Mouth Awards program. You, the
    readers, have sent us your picks for the lamest quotes from or about
    the world of technology during this eventful year. We have selected
    the "best" of those and present them to you now.Leading off with a
    stupid quote from President Bush might seem a little too easy,
    perhaps unfair, a bit like stealing candy from a blind kid or
    something. But in a year chockablock with moronic quips, obtuse
    observations and mind-boggling inanities, you still have to put
    Dubya front and center. He is, after all, the most powerful man in
    the world.

Wow! This is one "election" Pres. Bush deserves to win hands down. ;-)
Congratulations Mr.Bush :P
