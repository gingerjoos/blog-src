Long time since my last post :D This time I've a question for the
community.

I was thinking of getting myself a portable audio player and an
earphone. Haven't yet fully decided on what to buy though. I was
thinking of getting a Sennheiser CX 300 or 400. No clue about the player
though :(

I'm looking at spending a total of about 300 - 325 $ at the max. Highest
priority is sound quality. A must - have is the ability to use it on my
Linux machine, which means no restrictions like those on the iPod (can
add music only with the iTunes?). I would mostly use it on trains or
buses on long journeys (which is one reason I thought I would go for the
Sennheiser canalphones). Support for OGG and/or FLAC formats would be
nice. I don't really care for video support, I just want the music :D

Any suggestions? :)
